### Main Issue
Existing ESG agencies providing data that are extremely varied and opaque, keeping their methodologies hidden with no uniform standards for ratings or disclosures. The wide discrepancy between ESG ratings contributes to greenwashing making it incredibly difficult for investors to measure the impact of their investments. With many sustainable financial products relying on these complex and unknown ratings, it is critical to understand whatâ€™s behind this data affecting investment decisions, and to avoid another economic crisis fueled by opaque and complex ratings like in 2008.

This is where open source ESG data referential comes in. Creating an open source ESG data referential would eliminate the black box surrounding existing ESG ratings and disclosures through transparent methodologies and objective metrics, that gives investors a more accurate understanding of their impact. At FINGREEN AI, we believe that open source is the future of ESG data. We are creating the only transparent, traceable and customizable ESG solution to eliminate greenwashing and contribute to a truly sustainable financial system.

The EU understands this dire need and has been a pioneer with the SFDR, CSRD new requirements. We believe the brand-new EU Taxonomy is a great step towards uniformity and transparence in the ESG ecosystem, and we are proud to be a French start-up that tries to push these virtues to the entire world thanks to our technology.
